        </div>
        <p> Applus Energie is a project aimed at the creation of a system for monitoring energy consumption and climate quality. It is a project co-founded by Regione Autonoma Valle d'Aosta within the context of Alcotra Innovazione.</p>
        <p> Two monitoring systems were implemented during this project in two different buildings of Politecnico di Torino: the first one located in Verrès (AO) and the second located in Mirafiori (Cittadella del Design e della Mobilità) of Politecnico di Torino. The main goal is to show to the students their consumption in a clear manner, creating a greater awareness.</p>
        <p> In the context of Applus Energie, some Living Labs were leaded in order to share proposals or ideas during the phase of the interface designing.</p>
        <p> Proxima Centauri developed the system in collaboration with the Elite research group of Politecnico di Torino.</p>
